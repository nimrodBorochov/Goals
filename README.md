A portfolio app demonstrating my iOS development capabilities.

## About the App

This portfolio app is a personalized version of Apple's Feedback Assistant. While it won't be identical, it offers some unique features, such as the ability for users to create custom tags and freely edit and filter goals. Using CoreData and iClude for true syncing between devices.
The primary goal of this app is to showcase my iOS development skills and serve as a template that others can adapt to fit their own interests and needs.

## Key Features

- **Goal Tracking:** Allows users to track and manage goals effectively.
- **Custom Tags:** Users can create custom tags for better organization.
- **Goal Filter:** Allows users to filter goals effectively.
- **Earning Awards:** Users can earn awards based on their uses

3. Run (command+R)

## Important Choices

In developing this app, I made certain architectural choices and considerations:

- **MVVM Architecture:** Utilized the MVVM architectural pattern for clean code separation.
- **Extensive Testing:** Ensured thorough test coverage for reliability.
- **Accessibility Focus:** Prioritized making the app accessible to all users.
- **Internationalization and localization:** The app was designed to work in English and Hebrew
- **Linting:** Making code easier to read
- **Documenting:** Code comments and Documentation, Provides context on why it works a certain way, what assumptions I made, any optimizations I made, as well as describing subtleties in the implementation if dealing with difficult code.
