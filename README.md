A portfolio app demonstrating my iOS development capabilities.

## About the App

This portfolio app is a personalized version of Apple's Feedback Assistant. While it won't be identical, it offers some unique features, such as the ability for users to create custom tags and freely edit and filter issues. Using coredata and iClude for true syncing between devices.
The primary goal of this app is to showcase my iOS development skills and serve as a template that others can adapt to fit their own interests and needs.

## Key Features

- **Issue Tracking:** Allows users to track and manage issues effectively.
- **Custom Tags:** Users can create custom tags for better organization.
- **Issue Filter:** Allows users to filter issues effectively.
- **Earning Awards:** Users can earn awards based on their uses

## Getting Started

To get started with this app, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Manage your signing at Xcode
3. Run (command+R)

## Important Choices

In developing this app, I made certain architectural choices and considerations:

- **MVVM Architecture:** Utilized the MVVM architectural pattern for clean code separation.
- **Extensive Testing:** Ensured thorough test coverage for reliability.
- **Accessibility Focus:** Prioritized making the app accessible to all users.
- **Internationalization and localization:** The app was designed to work in English and Hebrow
- **Linting:** Making code easier to read
- **Documenting:** Code comments and Documentation, Provides context on why it works a certain way, what assumptions I made, any optimizations I made, as well as describing subtleties in the implementation if dealing with difficult code.
